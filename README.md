# 🎮 Minestom Server Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a Minecraft developer specializing in **Minestom**, the modern, async-first server platform. I build scalable, performant, and cleanly written systems — from full server setups to custom gameplay mechanics.

---

## 🛠️ What I Build

- Custom minigames (duels, parkour, capture-the-flag, etc.)
- Full server setups with optimized performance
- Modular game managers and efficient game loops
- Scoreboards, boss bars, particles, and UI systems
- Reliable data saving/loading with custom object serializers
- Custom entities, packet listeners, and event systems
